# phone-book
A small phone app utilizing AJAX.

Not fully functional as an AJAX application, but it CRUDs perfect on with PHP and MySQL. (Okay, minus you can't edit records once they are created. That functionality is for later, maybe.)

This app survives as a historical curiousity. It was the first thing I built under a professional deadline. It was the most difficult work I'd ever done up to that point. Unfortunately, my grasp of the DOM and of HTTP verbs wasn't up to my ambitions quite yet.

I am currently working on a revised version that actually works. It will see the light of day _soon_, I promise.

tl;dr This app doesn't actually work.
